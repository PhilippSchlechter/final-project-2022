## Walkthrough
To create a personal bookshelf you need an account. (For password hashing I used bcrypt).
On the private profile page you can (CRUD) add, edit, delete etc. books for your bookshelf.
Clicking the button "template" leads you to the single book page where you can add key takeaways, ideas, opinions
about the specific book. In the header you can find the option also to search for other users and look at their
bookshelf.

## Planned Features
- Comment on other user's bookshelves
- Fully responsiveness
